<h3> Main Functionalities </h3>
</a>
This page lists the main functionalities provided by JMF 2.X. With JMF2.X,
one could playback the media coming from stored data, live captured data or
real-time stream received from network. Besides, one could also broadcast
the media over network or export the media to a local file.

<table border=1>
<tr><td rowspan=3> <b>Media Source</b></td><td>Media files</td><td> source media comes
from stored files.</td></tr>
<tr><td>RTP receive</td><td>source media is the real-time stream received from
network via RTP/RTSP.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Capture</td><td> source media comes from the capture device, e.g., 
microphone or camera.</td></tr>
<tr><td rowspan=3> <b>Media Sink</b> </td><td>Play</td><td> playback, rendering 
the source media to speaker, monitor, etc. </td></tr>
<tr><td> RTP Transmit</td><td> Broadcast the source media across network via
RTP/RTSP </td></tr>
<tr><td>Transcode</td><td> Export the source media into a file. </td></tr>
<tr><td rowspan=2><b>Optional Component</b></td><td>Player Bean</td><td>JMF player as a java bean component </td></tr>
</tr><td>Demo & Tool</td><td> <b>JMStudio</b> is an application demo bundled in JMF2.X. <b>Please note </b> that JMStudio touches a lot of areas of JMF, once it is selected, it will increase the size of target jar file. <br> <b>JMFRegistry</b> is a useful tool bundled in JMF2.X to manage JMF plugin registry.</td></tr>
</table>
<br><br>

<b>Option to generate two target jar files </b> is useful if JMF is deployed via <b>JavaWebStart</b>. It will create two target jar files: core_custom.jar  contains all the core classes and plugin_custom.jar contains all the plugable classes. Then, you have to include both jar files into your classpath.
